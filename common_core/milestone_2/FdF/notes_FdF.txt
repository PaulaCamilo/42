PROJECT GUIDELINES
1) Result should be displayed using an isometric projection;
2) Program should display an image in a window;
3) Management of the window should remain smooth, including:
	- changing the window;
	- minimize it;
	- close it;
	- etc.;
4) Pressing the ESC key (!!)AND(!!) clicking on the cross at the top of the window
   should close the window and exit the program clearly;
5) Is mandatory to use the MiniLibX images.

STEPS TO CREATE FdF
1) Understand Minilibx and set it up;
2) Read the file(height, width, map);
3) Drawing the line algorithm;
4) Drawing the line between every dot;
5) Adding 3D (isometric view);
6) Adding bonus (another type of projection, translation, rotation, zoom...).

PARSING
1) Check the file name;
2) Read the file using get_next_line;
3) Store the map in a 2D array of integers and allocate the memory accordingly;
4) Store everything in a structure to use it later on, which includes:
	- map width;
	- map height;
	- map itself;
	- and another map containing the colors imbedded in the map.
